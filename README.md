# Wind-Turbine-Generation
Creating a graphical wind turbine using OpenGL in C++ is an exciting project that combines programming skills with 3D graphics rendering. With this project, you can showcase your proficiency in C++ programming and OpenGL graphics programming while creating a visually appealing representation of a wind turbine.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- `C++`
- `OpenGL`
- `CMake`
- `Doxygen`
- `Testing Library`

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I start by creating a design of the 3D model of the wind turbine using basic geometric shapes such as rectangles for the base pole and triangular shapes for the blades.
Defined the vertices, edges, and faces of each component of the wind turbine using the OpenGL(GLUT) function with custom vertex data.

Made use of transformation matrices to rotate the blades about their axes, here a circle on top of the pole was created to make it the axis of rotation for the Turbine blades. Controlled the rotation speed based on user input which is acquired from an external file, the speed at which the turbine rotates updates every 5 secs.

Optimized the code and rendering pipeline for better performance. Fine-tuned the appearance of the wind turbine model, lighting effects, and rendering settings.

For documentation of the project, I made use of Doxygen software, which required a certain way of commenting on the source code.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking. Gained in-depth knowledge of handling the OpenGL library for 3D rendering.


## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the OpenGL and Doxygen libraries.
3. Make modifications to the CMakeLists.txt file according to the path of the libraries to get the project started.
4. Build the project and run the executable `./turbine`
